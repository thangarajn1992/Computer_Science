| Kernel                          | The operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer usually called as kernel                                                         |
| System Programs                 | Programs that are associated with the operating system but are not part of the kernel.                                                                        |
| Application Programs            | All programs that are not associated with the operation of the system.                                                                                        |
| Uniform Memory Access(UMA)      | Access from any RAM to any CPU takes same amount of time                                                                                                      |
| Non Uniform Memory Access(NUMA) | Some parts of memory take longer to access than other parts                                                                                                   |
| Process                         | A Program loaded into main memory is called process                                                                                                           |
| Job Scheduling                  | If there are multiple programs that are ready to be brought into main memory, then choosing among them is call job scheduling                                 |
| CPU Scheduling                  | If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, the system must choose among them. Making this decision is CPU scheduling                                  |
| Virtual Memory                  | A technique that allows the execution of a process that is not completely in main memory                                                                      |
| System Calls                    | System calls provide the means for a user program to ask the operating system to perform tasks reserved for the operating system on the user program's behalf |
